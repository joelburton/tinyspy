# Area: crosswords

**Brand: CrossPlay.** The codename is what the code says everywhere; the
brand appears in the manifest's `BRAND` and nowhere else.

One of the sixteen game areas. The process is [app-audit.md](../app-audit.md)
§4; the plan holds the order, this file holds the reading. Owed work lives in
`src/crosswords/todo.md`, not here.

**Status: NOT OPENED.**

**Two passes, back to back**: the audit — React, SQL and CSS together — then
the tile-feedback pass against [tile-feedback.md](../tile-feedback.md).

## The roster

*(agreed with Joel when the area opens — `src/crosswords/`, its two SQL files,
and `docs/games/crosswords.md`. List the files and STOP)*

## Findings

*(`F-crosswords-1 · slug · title`, one heading each; a status prefix when it
has one, no prefix means OPEN)*

## Notes

*(things worth remembering about this area that are neither a finding nor
owed work — a forward-fix made from another area, a question for the opening,
a dependency listed and left. Anything durable goes to `todo.md` or
`docs/games/crosswords.md` instead; a note here never stands in for either)*

## Predicted test breaks

*(the spec names, written when the area starts changing things)*

## Closing

- [ ] the whole area re-read in one sitting after the last group
- [ ] `docs/games/crosswords.md` reconciled with `todo.md`: its Deferred
      section moved into the todo, or deliberately kept as the standing register
- [ ] the tile-feedback pass done, and the game's tf level updated there
- [ ] `todo.md` holds everything still owed; nothing durable left in this file
- [ ] every file on the roster blessed, or its stamp says why not
