 * adds (which past turn, if any, is open on the board) plus the affordances to
 * enter/leave it. Shared by every game whose board can replay past turns (scrabble,
 * stackdown, waffle, …); extracted once turn-history reached three games (the rule
 * of three — see docs/playarea-decomposition-plan.md).
 *
 * What stays per-game (deliberately NOT here): how a snapshot is COMPUTED from the
 * viewed id (each game's `lib/history` — the board shape differs per game, and it's
 * derived after the loading guard where the log/plays live), and how a turn is
 * IDENTIFIED (scrabble keys by a game-wide `seq`; stackdown/waffle by log position —
 * hence the `Id` generic). The game keeps its one-liner
 * `const snap = viewing ? gameSnapshot(viewingId) : null`.
 *
 * Wiring per game:
 *   - board renders `snapshot ?? live` and applies the shared `.frame` while
 *     `viewing` (which also makes it click-through — see below)
 *   - the turn log hangs a `<TurnLogNumber>` on each turn: `onSelect={() =>
 *     select(id)}`, `viewing={viewingId === id}`
 *   - a bare keystroke returns to live: `exitOnKey` (event-carrying key handlers) or
 *     `viewing` + `exitViewing` (event-less ones)
 *
 * Exit-on-CLICK is NOT wired per game — it's built in here: a click anywhere returns
 * to live (skipping the `#N` handles). Games needn't add a board-click handler.
