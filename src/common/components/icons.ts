/**
 * Semantic icon registry — the ONE place that maps an action to its Lucide
 * glyph, so "hint = lightbulb" lives here instead of being re-decided at every
 * call site. Components import the semantic name (`<IconHint />`), never Lucide
 * directly; change a glyph here and every game's button follows.
 *
 * This is the code form of the icon map in docs/ui.md → "Button iconography".
 * Names are PascalCase because they render as JSX (`<IconHint />`) — a lowercase
 * alias would be parsed as a DOM tag, not a component. They're the same Lucide
 * components, so they take the same props (`size`, `aria-hidden`, …). The set
 * grows as more buttons adopt it.

  // counter filling left-to-right — a USED mark is a red square-X, an OPEN slot a
  // dashed square. Squares (not circles) so they never read as the player-identity
  // disc (docs/ui.md → Player identity = a colored disc). First used by
  // connections' mistakes; reusable for any limited-attempts counter.
